<h3>From the Readme.txt of the original project</h3>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See &#39;features_info.txt&#39; for more details. </p>

<h3>Objectives of Coursera Project</h3>

<p>Created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </p></li>
<li><p>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. </p></li>
<li><p>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Design of run_analysis.R</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>All file directories are relative to &#39;UCI HAR Dataset&#39; main directory. </p></li>
<li><p>The 2 main sub-directories are train and test which contain the data files: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>X_train.txt</b> and <b>X_test.txt</b> (measurement data)</li>
<li><b>y_test.txt</b> and <b>y_train.txt</b> (activity codes)</li>
<li><b>subject_test.txt</b> and <b>subject_train.txt</b> (IDs of the volunteers)</li>
<li><b>activity_labels.txt</b> in the main directory (labels corresponding to the activity codes)</li>
<li><b>features.txt</b> contains the descriptions of each column of the measurement data. The file <b>names.txt</b> is modifed version of features.txt</li>
<li><b>meanStd.txt</b> (created for this project) contains the descriptions of columns that will go in the &#39;tidy&#39; data frame. It is a subset of names.txt.</li>
<li><b>codebook.md</b> contains </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Read each of the files into their respective data frames</p></li>
<li><p>Add activity codes and subject ids to the data frames as columns</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the activity codes with the activity labels</p></li>
<li><p>Combine each of the train and test sets into a single data frame (final data frame)</p></li>
<li><p>File names.txt is derived from features.txt and contains the column names to be used in the final data frame. Names in features.txt are not very R-friendly. All hyphens, parenthesis were replaced by periods. (Although, mixed-case and periods are not considered standard, they were retained to keep the names readable).</p></li>
<li><p>Using &#39;melt&#39; the data frame is re-shaped so the subject and activity label codes are first and the data frame is sorted with the subject and activity labels as keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Using dcast and mean the averages are calculated for each subject-activity aggregate.</p></li>
<li><p>This yeilds a tidy data frame</p></li>
</ol>
